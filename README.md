One simple-to-implement trick dramatically improves the speed at which [Neural ODEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) and [Neural CDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926) can be trained. (As much as doubling the speed.)

Backpropagation through a Neural ODE/CDE can be performed via the "adjoint method", which involves solving another differential equation backwards in time. However it turns out that default numerical solvers are unnecessarily stringent when solving the adjoint equation, and take too many steps, that are too small.

Tweaking things slightly reduces the number of function evaluations on the backward pass **by as much as 62%**. (Exact number will be problem-dependent, of course.)

_[torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) now supports this feature natively!_

## Summary:
If you're using [torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) (at least version 0.1.0) then replace
```python
import torchdiffeq

func = ...
y0 = ...
t = ...
torchdiffeq.odeint_adjoint(func=func, y0=y0, t=t)
```
with
```python
import torchdiffeq

def rms_norm(tensor):
    return tensor.pow(2).mean().sqrt()

def make_norm(state):
    state_size = state.numel()
    def norm(aug_state):
        y = aug_state[1:1 + state_size]
        adj_y = aug_state[1 + state_size:1 + 2 * state_size]
        return max(rms_norm(y), rms_norm(adj_y))
    return norm

func = ...    
y0 = ...
t = ...
torchdiffeq.odeint_adjoint(func=func, y0=y0, t=t, 
                           adjoint_options=dict(norm=make_norm(y0)))
```
That's it.
